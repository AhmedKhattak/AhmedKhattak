#### learning/trying
Currently learning GraphQL. After which ill try different clients and stick with one. Then probably learn rust maybe.



#### projects and hacks
Currently working on replicating scrimbas user interface. Really interesting to see how it will work in the end. I do have some ideas on how to make it work. Just gotta translate that to actual code.
